# Notes App - React & Firebase

## Overview

This is a simple and efficient Notes App built using **React** for the frontend and **Firebase** for backend services, including authentication and real-time database storage. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes while securely storing the data in the cloud. It is designed to help users keep track of tasks, thoughts, or information they want to jot down.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
- **Real-time Database**: All notes are stored in Firebaseâ€™s real-time NoSQL database, enabling users to access their notes from any device.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes easily.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase**: Backend services including Authentication, Firestore (real-time database), and Hosting.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application for a clean and responsive UI.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in the application.
